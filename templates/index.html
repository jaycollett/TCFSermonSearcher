  <h2>The Inspiration Behind This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This project was born from a light-hearted moment during a <strong>Craw/LaSage homegroup</strong> meeting.
    As we shared together, <strong>Brian Craw</strong> mentioned how amazing it would be to 
    easily search through past sermons to find something he remembered from one of the past sermons.
  </p>
  <p>
    With my proclivity for technology, I took this idea and developed a solutionâ€”<strong>Sermon Search</strong>.
    This web application automatically transcribes sermons and makes them searchable,
    allowing anyone to quickly search through past sermons from TCF.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope this tool helps deepen your connection with the teachings and makes it easier 
    to reflect on past messages. Enjoy exploring, and may these sermons continue to bless you!
  </p>
